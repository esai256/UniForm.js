UniForm.js
==========

The objective of developing UniForm is unifying the development of forms on the clientside with JavaScript.
What it should do:
- handling with different datatypes without a problem
- handle any controltypes the same
- extensible to the max

It should be: 
- small
- super-flexiblbe
- easy to learn
- fast
- "object-oriented" as much as javascript allows it
- built with new standards but babel-compatible
- not dependent on other frameworks as much as possible
  - not sure on this one
  - may use underscore
  - highland would be pretty interesting but that should be a different version
  - jQuery should not be used, but not on all costs
